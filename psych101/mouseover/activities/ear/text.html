    <li><span class="hoverable hoverable-text" data-label="step3" data-trackable="1" data-contentCode="Step 3" data-eventLabel="textHoverArea">The eardrum is attached to a lever made of three small bones, called <em>ossicles</em>, which vibrate along with the eardrum.  These ossicles, the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, intensify and transfer the vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.   </span></li>

Vibrations against the oval window cause a watery fluid inside the cochlea to vibrate, as well as a structure inside the cochlea called the <em>basilar membrane</em>.</span></li>
